/*Problem
Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if
the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three angles A, B and C, of 
the triangle separated by space.

Output
For each test case, display 'YES' if the triangle is valid, and 'NO', if it is not, in a new line.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int T,A,B,C,i,sum ;
	cin>>T;
	for(i=1;i<=T;i++){
	    cin>>A>>B>>C;
	    sum = A+B+C;
	    if(sum == 180){
	        cout<<"YES"<<endl;
	    }else{
	        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}
