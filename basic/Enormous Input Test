/*Problem
The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning.
You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.*/


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n,k,i,a;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int count=0;
    for (i=0;i<=n-1;i++){
        cin >> a;
        if (a%k==0)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
    return 0;
}
